        <h1>Nearby Connect Child Safety Standards and Policies</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 13, 2025 | <strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 13, 2025</p>
    </header>

    <section id="commitment">
        <h2>1. Our Commitment to Child Safety</h2>
        <p>At Nearby Connect, we are committed to creating a safe, inclusive, and positive environment for all users. Our app is designed to foster meaningful connections among individuals aged 13-35 in their local communities. We take child safety extremely seriously and have implemented robust measures to prevent, detect, and respond to child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE). This policy outlines our standards, practices, and commitments in compliance with global child safety laws, including those from the United States (e.g., COPPA), the European Union (e.g., GDPR), and India (e.g., POCSO Act).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Age Restrictions:</strong> Nearby Connect is intended for users aged 13 and above. We do not allow users under 13 to create accounts or access the app. Upon account creation, users must confirm they are at least 13 years old. We use age verification mechanisms (e.g., self-reported date of birth) and reserve the right to suspend or delete accounts if we suspect underage use.</li>
            <li><strong>No Tolerance for CSAE:</strong> We strictly prohibit any content, behavior, or interactions that involve or promote child sexual abuse material (CSAM), exploitation, grooming, or any form of harm to minors. This includes sharing explicit images, soliciting inappropriate interactions, or using the app for predatory purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Proactive Prevention:</strong> Our platform uses AI-powered content moderation to scan profiles, messages, and uploaded media for potential CSAE indicators. We also employ human moderators to review flagged content and conduct regular audits.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="prevention">
        <h2>2. Prevention Measures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Verification and Monitoring:</strong> All users must provide accurate profile information. We monitor for suspicious activity, such as repeated account creations or interactions with minors.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Filtering:</strong> Automated tools block uploads of explicit or harmful content. Users are educated on acceptable behavior through in-app prompts and onboarding.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Guidelines:</strong> Users must agree to our terms, which explicitly ban CSAE-related activities. Violations result in immediate account suspension.</li>
            <li><strong>Parental Controls and Education:</strong> We encourage parents to monitor their children's use of the app and provide resources on digital safety within the app.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="reporting">
        <h2>3. Reporting and Response Mechanisms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>In-App Reporting:</strong> Users can report concerns directly within the app via a dedicated "Report" button on profiles, messages, or events. Reports are reviewed within 24 hours by our moderation team.</li>
            <li><strong>External Reporting:</strong> We integrate with national hotlines and authorities. In India, we report to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and Cyber Crime units. Internationally, we comply with requirements like the U.S. National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and EU reporting obligations.</li>
            <li><strong>Response Time:</strong> Confirmed CSAE incidents are escalated immediately to law enforcement. We preserve evidence and cooperate fully with investigations.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We maintain records of all reports and actions taken, available for audit upon request by authorities.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="compliance">
        <h2>4. Compliance with Laws and Standards</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legal Frameworks:</strong> We adhere to all relevant laws, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>India's Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012.</li>
                    <li>U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</li>
                    <li>EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Digital Services Act (DSA).</li>
                    <li>Global standards from organizations like the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) and UNICEF.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Audits and Certifications:</strong> We undergo annual third-party audits for child safety compliance and aim to achieve certifications like the Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI) standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> User data is encrypted and stored securely. We do not share personal information without consent, except as required for legal compliance.</li>
        </ul>
